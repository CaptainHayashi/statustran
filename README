--== statustran ==--

statustran is a largely proof-of-concept translator for Hurd-based GNU 
distributions, using a curl backend to publish the contents of any 
140-character-or-fewer file copied into its node to a given StatusNet 
account (by default, identi.ca)

statustran is heavily based on the FSF's example code for trivfs 
translators.


-- Requirements --

For now, statustran requires:

>> Intel x86.

>> GNU Hurd on Mach microkernel.

>> curl.  The path of curl is hardcoded into main.c and will need 
   changing if curl is not in /bin.

>> An account on a StatusNet microblog.  identi.ca's URL is 
   hardcoded into the program by default, but you are free to 
   change this.


-- Compilation --

A simple Makefile has been provided that should be sufficient. 
Just run make.


-- Usage --

Use settrans to start the translator, passing --userauth=USERNAME:PASSWORD 
while doing so.  See Hurd documentation for how to use settrans, though the 
following:

  settrans -fgap node statustran --userauth=USERNAME:PASSWORD

should work.

Then, you may use the translator node as a writable file:

  echo "Status" > node


-- Known issues --

1) statustran reacts violently to large inputs.

2) curl's output tends to clog up terminals.

3) It just isn't very good or useful at all. >=P


-- Why curl is needed (as opposed to libcurl) --

Incompatibilities in the threading department (libcurl uses pthreads, the 
Hurd uses cthreads) cause both to fail to work together in a translator 
context.

If anyone knows of a HTTP library that uses cthreads, or no threads, 
please let me know at hayashi .:at:. archhurd .:dot:. org.
